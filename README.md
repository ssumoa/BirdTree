# BirdTree
making 28 trees by using Recursion(L-system) each tree is made by a Korean migratory bird population.  The number of digits in the data is related to the height of the tree and the rate of increase or decrease in data is related to the survival rate of each branch of the tree. (as the bird population decrease, each tree has fewer branches.)
